                 It is our belief that nothing exists by itself in this world. We co-exist with one another and we are interdependent on one another. This creates greater dimension and contributes colours to the earth. Good designs are not good enough; a great product is one that will be able to sell itself. We believe that the design that sells is the design that is most relevant and appealing to the consumer, besides the aesthetic aspect. We are ahead of design trends, and in fact, trend setters because we dare to be different in our thinking process. We are critical in design concepts, yet able to provide long terms solutions. We possess the know how in integrating components and issues that will provide comprehensive, practical and economic solutions in terms of operations of human resources, operating cost, and profit. One of our main concern is in providing an outstanding design but also in the preservation of our clients resources as well.

                  From day one, our main focus has been in interior designing. We have completed many projects, ranging from residential to corporate clients. Our core strength has always been in the area of identifying our clients' image and their needs during our design process. We are capable of developing new and current corporate images for new company startups as well as for companies that are looking into changing their corporate image. Our clients range from retail, corporate companies, hospitality, to government agencies. We walk through the entire design process with our clients from the ground zero to the completion of each projects. We work closely with our dedicated team of architectures, designers, professional engineers, and contractors under our wing. We are able to customize our scope of work as per our client's requirement from design stage, project management, construction stage and to handing over of project to our client.

                    Since 2004, due to our strong connections in China, we have branched into architecture from interior designing. We have had fruitful cooperation with many of our China counterparts in different cities and provinces of China. However, our main focal point has been in the Hainan Province due to it having the highest numbers of hotels and resorts; the "Hawaii of China" as many have named. Recently, we have surveyed sites with drones for a more thorough inspection and recommend the sites which are optimal for our clients usage.

                 In 2008, we ventured into the specialization of acoustic environments whether it be for supporting artistes or sound engineers in the region. Thereafter, we involved ourselves in the designing and building up of different environments, from casino gaming spaces, indoor firing ranges, lecture halls, recording studios, broadcasting rooms, home theatres, etc.

                 In 2014, we entered Myanmar market. We are slowly gaining momentum in the design & construction industries.
